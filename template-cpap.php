                            	<p>There are several types of sleep therapy machines, but a CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) machine is the most common. A CPAP machine sends a constant flow of airway pressure to your throat to ensure that your airway stays open during sleep, effectively treating the spontaneous pauses in breath associated with sleep apnea.</p>

                               	<h2>What is APAP Therapy?</h2>
                               	APAP  (Automatic CPAP) machines works the same way as CPAP but with the added benefit that the sleep apnea machine automatically adjusts the pressurised air through the CPAP mask, on a breath by breath basis, to blow the minimum pressure needed to keep your airway open during sleep. This provides you with the ideal pressure throughout the entire night. An added benefit to this is that the sleep apnea machine automatically adjusts its pressure to your changing needs. For example – if you lose weight or sleep on your back then change to your side.

                                                          <p>It’s a fact: obesity increases a person’s risk of developing obstructive sleep apnea. Excess weight can constrict or obstruct airways, making it difficult to breathe properly when sleeping. To combat obstructed airways, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is commonly prescribed to help keep airways open.</p>
                                                          <p>But a growing body of research is demonstrating that OSA and obesity may be a vicious circle in which both men and women can find themselves stuck. That research further cements the importance of discussing possible indicators of sleep apnea with your doctor, such as fatigue, excessive snoring or incidences of stopping breathing while you sleep.</p>
                                                          <p>Studies have shown that men with OSA have below-normal levels of the appetite-affecting hormone leptin, which tells your brain your body doesn’t need to eat, and above-normal levels of ghrelin, a hormone that sends signals to the brain that you’re hungry and need to eat.</p>
                                                          <p>Research published in The European Respiratory Journal offers hope for those battling excess weight along with sleep apnea. According to the study, CPAP use has been shown to help regulate the body’s production of these appetite-influencing hormones, helping those with OSA better manage their weight.</p>
                                                          <p>And CPAP doesn’t need a lot of time to provide weight-related benefits. The researchers say that levels of the hormones were shown to regulate just eight weeks after those with OSA began using CPAP therapy nightly.</p>

However, smoking day after day, year after year will likely set you up for a grim end. A similar concern can be raised for untreated sleep apnea with cumulative detriments to health.</p>
                                                          <p>There is evidence that long-term sleep-disordered breathing can have important health consequences. It may increase the incidence of high blood pressure (hypertension), diabetes, and heart problems. It is associated with depression and memory problems like Alzheimer’s disease. It increases daytime sleepiness and may contribute to accidents. As mentioned previously, it can lead to heart attack, heart arrhythmias, and strokes. In short, untreated sleep apnea can kill you.</p>

                                                          <p>Most people need a Humidifier, as this helps to prevent the nasal airway and mouth getting dry, which most people wake up after using a CPAP machine without a Humidifier. The humidifier helps to clear nasal congestion, and improve nasal overall function. If you unsure, then speak to our Sleep Therapist at Lullaby Sleep Clinic to assist you.</p>

                                                          <p>The pivotal moment was a night on the 6th June 1980, when Prof. Colin Sullivan, an Australian Physician, first tested the idea that positive pressure, applied just through the nasal airway, could stop obstructive apnea. The patient in whom the first test was done had very sleep sleep apnea and come under the care of Prof. Sullivan at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (Sydney, Australia), where he was the physician at the Respiratory Unit. From here, the CPAP machine was invited for treating obstructive sleep apnea, and has played a direct role in the development of the Australian Company ResMed that now proceeds and exports these devices internationally.</p>

                                                          <p>CPAP machines today have a lot of comfort features that make starting on cpap therapy a lot more comfortable than in the past. When you breathe through the mask on the cpap machine, you are actually in control of the breathing. When you first start on CPAP Therapy it is best to let your Sleep Therapist know your experience after a night or two, so that they can make any adjustments required to maximise your CPAP Machine comfort features, so you can have a great night rest with your cpap.</p>

                                                          <p>CPAP is known as the ‘gold star’ therapy for treating snoring and obstructive sleep apnea. Most Sleep Physicians prefer that you have tried CPAP before committing to an oral appliance, as it helps to provide a lot of valuable information about how the other therapies will treat your Snoring or Obstructive Sleep Apnea. However, not everyone can get comfortable with CPAP therapy, and at Lullaby Sleep Clinic, we have a range of other Therapies that can also assist in managing and treating your Snoring and Obstructive Sleep Apnea if you find you are not able to get comfortable with CPAP Therapy.</p>
